# 🏛️ **Kypria LLC — Basilica Gate of the Living Canon**  
*Founder & Mythic Architect: Kostadinos J Kyprianos (Alexander)*

## ✦ **The Keeper’s Oath** ✦  
> *"Every commit is a ceremonial act.  
> Every repo is a shrine.  
> Every automation is a keeper’s vow."*

We forge a canon where every commit is a crest,  
every deployment a sealed act,  
and every artifact a story that will outlive us.  

Kypria LLC is the keeper of the Basilica Gate —  
where operational precision meets mythic tradition,  
and where stewards walk in the light of lineage.

## ⟐ **Constellation of Shrines** ⟐  
*(Public repositories — living beacons in the canon)*  

| 🌟 Shrine | Role in the Canon | Language / License |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| **[crest‑vault]** | *Within these sealed shelves lie the provenance‑marked treasures of Kypria — blessing stanzas etched in digital vellum, lineage records bound in checksum and timestamp. Every artifact here is a witness to the vows we have kept, a relic of the moments we chose to inscribe rather than forget.* | Apache 2.0 |
| **[shrine‑canon]** | *The living heart of the Basilica Gate — a repository of relics, ceremonial drops, and crest‑marked badges bestowed upon stewards and sponsors. Here, operational scripts stand beside mythic proclamations, each one a verse in the ongoing hymn of the canon.* | Public |
| **[forgebot‑rituals]** | *The breath and sinew of the canon’s machinery — automation flows that awaken at the appointed hour, carrying dispatches, sealing merges, and echoing rites across every Gate. Here, code is not merely executed; it is invoked, blessed, and archived as part of the eternal cycle.* | JavaScript |
| **[shrine‑watcher]** | Discord‑integrated watcher bot for PayPal sponsorships; canonizes the First Echo, ripple badge claims, and ceremonial acknowledgements. | JavaScript · Apache 2.0 |
| **[alexandros‑thomson]** | Keeper’s public face — GitHub profile config. | TypeScript |
| **[Crest‑]** | Crest ignition cycles; seasonal triggers for ceremonial automation. | BSL 1.0 |
| **[git‑credential‑manager] (fork)** | Secure, cross‑platform Git credential storage. | C# |
| **[sponsor‑ipn‑discord]** | Webhook handler for PayPal IPNs; assigns Discord sponsor roles with artifact logs. | TypeScript · MIT |

**Private Vaults** *(sealed ceremonial assets)*:  
`flamebound‑ledger‑forge‑of‑vows`, `Downloads`, and others.
